# PS1 List Generator:


### Input asks for username (BITS Email ID) and password. If entered correctly, it generates the list of PS1 stations with domain and saves it in a csv file.

### Before running the script, execute this command in the terminal (use pip if python3 is not installed in the system)

```
pip3 install requirements.txt
```

To generate data, simply run:

```
python3 ps1.py
```

This generates the csv file in the same folder.

### NOTE: (The last three columns are dummy data as of now, I might tweak the code to actually generate those as well later its a pain)
